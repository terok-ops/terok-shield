"""Integration tests: network behavior during bypass mode.

Verifies actual traffic flows correctly when the shield is down:
all outbound traffic accepted (with logging), RFC1918 still rejected
by default, and IPv6 private ranges still rejected.

Traffic tests are split by protocol/port so that future rule changes
(e.g. different treatment for DNS vs HTTP) are caught individually.
