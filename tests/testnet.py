"""Shared test constants: IP addresses, domains, and URLs.

RFC 5737 TEST-NET addresses (192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24)
are reserved for documentation and testing.  They are guaranteed non-routable —
no real host will ever have them, and packets will be dropped at the network edge.

Public DNS IPs (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9) are used in integration tests that
verify real network connectivity.  Centralizing them here means SonarCloud only
flags the constant definition, not every usage.
